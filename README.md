### Sidebar Posts Plugin
This plugin is built to create a Custom Post Type, and allow admin to select six posts to show in a shortcode that is placed inside the theme. If user is viewing an article that is same article selected by admin to show in sidebar, then it shows a random article.

The plugin is built with very basic MVC approach, with frontend and backend css dependencies. This plugin is responsive in nature and has been tested in mobile and tablet prior to release.
